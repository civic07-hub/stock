📈 AI-Based Stock Market Predictor

An interactive stock trend prediction web application built using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit.
The system analyzes historical market data, identifies patterns, and predicts future stock trends.
Developed with assistance from Cursor AI to optimize code quality and workflow.

🚀 Features
	•	📊 Fetches real-time or historical stock price data
	•	🤖 Machine Learning–based prediction model
	•	📈 Visualized stock trends (charts, moving averages, predictions)
	•	🧮 Supports regression-based prediction models
	•	🌐 Interactive Streamlit interface
	•	⚙️ Modular, clean, and scalable backend code

  🛠 Tech Stack
	•	Python
	•	Streamlit
	•	Pandas, NumPy
	•	Scikit-Learn
	•	yFinance / CSV datasets
	•	Cursor AI (for assisted development)

  📘 How It Works
	1.	User inputs a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, TCS, INFY).
	2.	App loads historical stock data.
	3.	Machine Learning model processes the data.
	4.	The app displays:
	•	Price history
	•	Trend line graphs
	•	Predicted next-day price
	•	Movement indication (Uptrend/Downtrend)
  
📊 Model Overview
	•	Data is cleaned and normalized
	•	Split into training and test sets
	•	Trained using ML regression models
	•	Predicts future closing price
	•	Displayed graphically using Streamlit
